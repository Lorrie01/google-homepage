This is a project as part of my independent training with The Odin Project. 
It's designed to test and enhance the skills I have learned so far and strengthen
my knowlege of HTML & CSS.

The end result will be a Google page that I look forward to building.

Here it is, my completed Google page. 
One of the first things you learn on becoming a developer is patience. You also have to be extremely resourceful to figure out how to put things together. And lastly it is important to check, tweak, recheck again and get to a point where you feel that you have completed something you can be proud of. 
On the surface, a Google page looks pretty simple. When you take a closer look at it, you discover a very complex html document filled with detailed styling elements created for the information to display for your search results and links to your personal pages and apps.

I loved this learning experience.
